# S-IP-My-IP-
This program allows you to find out your IP, coordinates, and some information about your PC. However, if you obtain a token from the IPINFO website, create a Telegram bot, and fill in the details in the `tokens.json` file, you can use it to gather information about other users (do so at your own risk).
